I’ve decided to create a simple webpage incorporating the use of bootstrap5 surrounding points generated for my school’s House Points System 2024-2025. It features the teams Green, Red and Blue, the event in question, and the classes. A sum of the points was tallied. To satisfy the form elements and components, classes may be selected to view their respective team points according to their categories, and colors were added to add some level of visual appeal. 
Following a few tutorials, I was able to create the simple webpage ‘housepoints.html’. I do hope that you find it visually appealing and easy to maneuver.
